## Introduction
Handwritten digit recognition is a fundamental problem in the field of computer vision and machine learning. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits along with their corresponding labels (0 to 9). The goal of this project is to build a CNN model that can accurately classify these digits.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip
